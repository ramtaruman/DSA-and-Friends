# DSA-and-Friends
Library containing my practice works on Data Strucutres, Algorithms and misc. stuff


## FAQ

### Language used


C++

### Why isnt 'x' included

I havent got around to completing or properly implementing the mentioned topic

### Where should I practice from

"Heaps" of resources are available in the interwebz. That being said, I personally prefer websites like Leetcode and Codeforces.
Codeforces is more math focused and requires some speed.

### Books recommendation

CLRS is a very standard choice for algorithms but its usually perceived as a hard read.
The algorithm design manual or Open Data Structures, both are good.
