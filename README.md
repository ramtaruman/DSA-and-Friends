## FAQ

### Language used


C++

### Why isnt 'x' included

I havent got around to completing or properly implementing the mentioned topic

### Where should I practice from

"Heaps" of resources are available in the interwebz. That being said, I personally prefer websites like Leetcode and Codeforces.
Codeforces is more math focused and requires some speed.

### Books recommendation

If you are super beginner, then Grokking Algorithms.

For more indepth stuff, CLRS.

For practicing interview problems, CTCI.
